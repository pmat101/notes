- No need to prepare for DSA or aptitude
- Everyday: do assignments, Git Push, improve portfolio
- Add extra features to your projects to make your resume stand out from the crowd

- Learn to sell yourself and your work
- Use design tools like Canva, Figma or AdobeXD to make development less time consuming, use Pexels to grab stock images, Colorzilla to pick colours and UIColorpicker to mix-match colours

*The Bhagavad Gita teaches that we are here to fulfill our Dharma. It is the path of righteousness (different for each individual) and it's our duty to find and follow our Dharma [you don't need motivation for that, just descipline and consistancy]*
