1)  For official docs go to reactjs.org

2)  'create-react-app' is a utility that sets up a basic react application, it contains:
	i)  node_modules (all packages that react requires)
	ii)  .gitignore (what not to push to GitHub)
	iii) package.json (directory of all node module packages)
	iv) README.md (basic readme file)
	v) src (all react components go into this folder)
	vi) public (contains files availabe to user ie. public)

3)  'npm start' will get your react appgoing, use 'npm run build' to deploy to production

4)  'npm install' downloads all reqirements in node_modules folder according to package.json

5)  In JSX only a single parent element can be returned

6)  React uses Babel to compile JSX to HTML and Webpack which automatically allows us to import any CSS files etc

7)  Single page apps require req/res cycle only once. As soon as browser receives HTML+CSS+JS the JS takes over and handles HTML n CSS without any reload required

8)  When importing a component we can send values as prop(ertie)s
	- We can use 'proptypes' to check data type of prop
	- We can set default props for if no values get imported (alternatively we can use 'required' keyword)

9)  We can't assign variables in React, we use State management to do that
	"const [variable, function] = useState('default value')"

10)  "npm install react-router-dom" in your project folder

11)  import 'Switch' from above package to hop between components without refreshing the page (use -exact path-)

12)  import 'Link' and use it instead of <a> shuffle between components
