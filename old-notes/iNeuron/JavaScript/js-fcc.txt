Data Types in JS:	undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object

Variables not assigned any value are declared as 'undefined'

Variables declared using 'var' automatically assigned global scope, which is bad. for eg. if you want to re-run a function

Variables with the same name can only be declared once using 'let'

Variables declared using 'const' are read-only

*	push():	append item to the end of array
*	pop():	remove last element of array and return it
*	shift():	remove first element of array
*	unshift():	add item at the beginning of array

To call or invoke a function write its name followed by paranthesis

If a function doesn't have a return statement, the returned value is undefined

Functions can have default parameters if no arguments are given

Use bracket notation and quotes when object property names have spaces in them, or stored in a variable

*	'delete' : remove a property from an object
*	hasOwnProperty() : check if a property exists or not

Other methods - Math, parseInt, Object.freeze, concat..

'Template literals' are used to display text as is	(`My name is ${name}`)
