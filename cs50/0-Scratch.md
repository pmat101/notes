Computer Science is the study of information. How do you represent it, and how do you process it? And in that sense, computational thinking is just the application of ideas from computer science.

Computers use Binary system to represent data, 'A' is 65, 'B' is 66, '!' is 33, '1' is 49 and '2' is 50.
This pattern of 0s and 1s are interpretted differently in different softwares using data-types, text in email, numbers in Excel or colours in photoshop.
ASCII only used 8bits which gave only 256 possibilities, along came Unicode which used 32bits (a little expensive) but gave 4 billion possibilities to encorporate all languages and even emojis.
Emojis are characters and not pictures, so look different on each device just like fonts.

Hiding lower level details so that we can focus our attention on working on the higher level is called Abstraction.

Computer programs take actions called 'functions' based on 'conditionals' with 'booleans' done in cycles called 'loops'.

Functions let us implement algorithms and also work as abstraction

If you have a vision, you break it down into constituent parts and pluck off the easy ones first
