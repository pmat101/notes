to output anything to the console use **print()** statement

data types in Swift - *string*, *int*, *double*, *bool*

variable declaration- **var name:datatype = value**;  variables can't be reassigned value of a different type

a constant, declared using *let* keyword cannot be reassigned any value

function declaration- **func name( param:datatype ) -> datatype{ return value }**

functions can pass arguments using variable names, labels or just values

**Int.random(in: start...end)** method is used to generate a random number

to output anything to the console use **print()** statement
common data types in Swift - *string*, *int*, *double*, *bool* and *array*
variable declaration- **var name:datatype = value**;  (type declaration lets compiler know how much memory to set aside for the variable) variables can't be reassigned value of a different type
a constant, declared using *let* keyword cannot be reassigned any value
String Interpolation- "I am \(var_age) years old"
function declaration- **func name( param:datatype ) -> datatype{ return value }**
functions can pass arguments using variable names, labels or just values
**Int.random(in: start...end)** method is used to generate a random number
**...** is known as a Closed Range Operator ie first and last units are included, eg. 1985...1997
Switch statements can have multiple values in a case separated by comma
Use **where** keyword to check condition against given variable in a switch statement
Swift has *structures* (similar to objects in JS, dictionary in Python)
