## Journey of Building an App
- Never go with a completely brand new app idea as it's too risky take an already existing app and do it differently
- Focus on a small idea, that's bug free and has good UX which results in a polished app with good reviews
- Make multiple app and launch quickly, do get too attached to an app or idea
- Optionally you can add gamification, reminders, encouragement, social interaction, data and insights to your app
- Target low competetion organic keywords related to your app for SEO (refer ASO tools- appfollow and mobileAction- keyword tracking)
