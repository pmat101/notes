# The Ultimate cheat-sheet (All In):

- Be a JavaScript dev, not framework specific so you can apply for wide variety of jobs
- Do all assignments, don't skip any
- Do internship, freelance work and fill up your GitHub for a year
- No need to prepare for DSA or aptitude
- Everyday: do assignments, Git Push, improve portfolio
- Add extra features to your projects to make your resume stand out from the crowd
- Project reviews => complete requirement sets, write project report, documentation, include good practices, swagger, Postman collection
- MAANG companies have infra already built, they just want it optimised. Therefore they require SDE with DSA knowledge. Startups on the other hand require full-stack developers
- Learn to sell yourself and your work
- Use design tools like Canva, Figma or AdobeXD to make development less time consuming, use Pexels to grab stock images, Colorzilla to pick colours and UIColorpicker to mix-match colours
